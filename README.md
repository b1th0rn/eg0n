# eg0n :: IoC management project

eg0n is a Django-based application designed to archive and manage IoC and CTI data.
The project started in 2024 as an idea by @roccosicilia, proposed to the BitHorn community.

Its primary goal is to provide seamless integration of IoCs into third-party security tools, enabling more effective threat hunting and detection.
