    duplicate-code,                # R0801: Indicates that a set of similar lines has been detected among multiple file. This usually means that the code should be refactored to avoid this duplication.
    no-member,                     # E1101: Used when a variable is accessed for a nonexistent member (Django ORM attributes can confuse pylint).
    too-few-public-methods,        # R0903: Used when class has too few public methods, so be sure it's really worth it.
    too-many-ancestors,            # R0901: Used when class has too many parent classes, try to reduce this to get a simpler (and so easier to use) class.
    too-many-arguments,            # R0913: Used when a function or method takes too many arguments.
    too-many-branches,             # R0912: Used when a function or method has too many branches, making it hard to follow.

    too-many-lines,                # C0302: Used when a module has too many lines, reducing its readability.

    too-many-nested-blocks,        # R1702: Used when a function or a method has too many nested blocks. This makes the code less understandable and maintainable.
    too-many-positional-arguments, # Ro917: Too many positional arguments (%s/%s).

    too-many-statements,           # R0915: Used when a function or method has too many statements. You should then split it in smaller functions / methods.
